Dig out the turf and root zone that contains a white, cottony mass to a depth of 12 inches (30 cm) and 2 ft (60 cm) beyond the outer edge of the ring. Refill the area with clean soil and reseed or re-sod. Fungicides are available but they have not been observed to reliably control fairy ring.",

    "symptom": "Fusarium patch develops as circular patches 1 to 6 inches (2.5 - 15 cm) wide. Leaves appear watersoaked and are reddish-brown on the outside progressing to a straw color in the center. Dead leaves may have gelatinous spore masses. White or pink fungal threads may be observed in the early morning, giving the turf a pink cast.",
    "treatment": "Reduce shade and provide good soil aeration and water drainage. Irrigate at the recommended frequency for your turf species and avoid excess nitrogen fertilizer, especially in the fall. Maintain a soil pH between 6.5 and 6.7. You may need to have a professional soil analysis done to help you determine what amendments to add to maintain an ideal pH. High levels of potassium suppress disease. If Fusarium patch has been a serious problem in the past, have a licensed pest control applicator apply a fungicide in the fall before symptoms appear.",

Follow irrigation recommendations for your area and sprinkler output. Dethatch when the thatch layer exceeds 1/2 inch (1.2 cm) thick.
